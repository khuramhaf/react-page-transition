This is a demo React project in which I am doing page transistions. i am not usibg any animation library for tansistion. I am doign all the animation stuff in pure react.js. When the new component slides in from the left the previous component slides out from the right, when the browser's back button is clicked the component slides in from the right.


If you want to change the amination on the page transistion just go in App.css and change three classes "navstart", "navend" and navendfull you will see your animation will change.This app Might be used for animation testing


Looking forward to develop a professional project like this or any other. Contact me at contact@musk-technology.com
