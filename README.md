This is a demo React project in which I am doing page transistions. i am not usibg any animation library for tansistion. I am doign all the animation stuff in pure react.js. If you want to change the amination on the page transistion just go in App.css and change three classes "navstart", "navend" and navendfull you will see your animation will change.


Looking forward to develop a professional project like this or any other. Contact me at contact@musk-technology.com
